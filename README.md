# Mobile Price Classification Project
## Introduction
In today’s world, there are a wide range of mobile phones available, each with distinct features
and specifications. Analyzing these parameters can help the consumer make a smarter decision
on the price point of a mobile device. Mobile companies dictate the pricing of their devices by
the cost of each specification, labour and the stability of the economy.
Understanding which features are relevant to the price of a mobile device and which one of them
is affecting the price in higher scale can help the consumer make a mindful purchase.
## Objective
In this project our objective is to find a relation on how some of the features affect the price of
mobile phones. Price range is what we will predict based on the specific features of a phone, so
our target value is ‘y’ with values of : 
- 0 = low cost
- 1 = medium cost 
- 2 = high cost
- 3 = very high
cost.
## Dataset
The database that we used, was found on kaggle and its link is shown here:
[Mobile Price Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification).
In our project, we will use different methods to analyze the price range of mobile phones.
